			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img src="images/headshot.jpg">
			<p>I've been learning about software programming since I was fourteen, when I decided I wanted to learn how to make computer games.</p>
			<p>I studied C/C++, ASM and Python. Becoming interested in graphics programming I learned OpenGL and GLSL, and experimented with various techniques including shadow mapping, cel shading, volumetric ray marching, normal mapping, reflection, refraction and more.</p>
			<p>I started working at a call centre company that needed script webpages for its call operators, so I learned how to make ASP websites in VB.NET with WebPages. Subsequently, I learned C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Angular 1 and 2, and ASP.NET MVC. I also learned how to serve these websites with an IIS 6 webserver, and how to integrate them with MySQL databases. I also learned about technologies and concepts such as HTTP, SSL, CORS and REST.</p>
			<p>After I complete my current studies I hope to find a place in a company where I can learn how to work in a team of professionals to develop outstanding websites.</p>
